# Introduction

## What is this ?
A basic "hello world" single page web app that you can copy / paste to quickly start a project
As i am pretty much always choosing the web to develop the front-end part of my projects, I want to centralize and uniformise the structures of my code that run those UI. That's the reason this repo exist.
This is repos is free to consult, copy, use or whatever you wanna do with the code :)

## How do i start ?

### <u>1. Clone this repository</u>
Use one of the options in the big green dropdown named "Code" or use this command :
```
git clone https://github.com/Zyckl0n/Basic-SPA-Boilerplate.git
```

### <u>2. Get a HTTP server</u>
You'll need a ```https``` server, For a quick start on VS code, i recommand using the extension ["Live Server"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) (by Ritwick Dey)

Using this extension you'll only have to click the ```Go Live``` button on the bottom right of your VS Code

### <u>3. The hello world project should be running</u>
Go to http://127.0.0.1:5500/ (Default port is 5500) and you should have the app, up and runing
